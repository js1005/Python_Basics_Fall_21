# Python Basics, Fall 2021
 
Welcome! This is the github repo for the second half of the course 'Python Basics', Fall 2021, which is a 'Skills' course taught at the Kuehne Logistics Univsersity at Bachelor level. The course is an introduction to the fundamentals of the Python programming language. The second half of the course is all about dataframes, their manipulation, descriptive data analysis and visualizations.

This repo contains the material that we cover during class as well as the exercises that you are supposed to turn in to pass this course. It also contains a Notebook called 'recap' which covers the main take-aways from the first half of the course. If you have any question or comment on the material, please leave me a message: johanna.schnier@the-klu.org

# How do I download the material without installing git?

Click on 'Code', then 'Download zip'.

# I have troubles loading the titanic.csv ...

Copy the 'titanic.csv' to the same location as that of your notebooks. Then replace 'pd.read_csv('../python_basics_johanna/data/titanic.csv')' by 'pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')'. So, if the 'session_4' notebook runs smoothly until the point when you try to read in the data, this is probably because you have not adjusted the path accordingly. In general, you must always tell Python exactly where your data lies.
