# Python Basics, Fall 2021
 
This is the github repo for the second half of the course 'Python Basics', Fall 2021, which is a 'Skills' course taught at the Kuehne Logistics Univsersity at Bachelor level. The course is an introduction to the fundamentals of the Python programming language. The second half of the course is all about dataframes, their manipulation, descriptive data analysis and visualizations. This repo contains the material that we cover during class as well as the exercises that you must turn in to pass this course. It also contains a Notebook called 'recap' which covers the main take-aways from the first half of this course. If you have any question or comment on the material, please leave me a message: johanna.schnier@the-klu.org
