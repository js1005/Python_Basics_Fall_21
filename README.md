# Python Basics, Fall 2021
 
This is the github repo for the course 'Python Basics', Fall 2021, which is a 'Skills' course taught at the Kuehne Logistics Univsersity at Bachelor level. The course is an introduction to the fundamentals of the Python programming language. I teach the second half the course (in October), which revolves around dataframes and their manipulation. This repo contains the course material, including the syllabus, readings as well as slides/computer code.
