    "## Exercises Session 4\n",
    "In the exercices, we will keep working with the Titanic Dataframe. So, make sure to load the data in a first step (and don't forget to load the pandas and numpy modules as well). I will post solutions shortly after expiration of the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify that the variable 'PassengerId' is of type 'int64'. Then change it to string (or object) datatype. Why does this make sense?\n",
    "2. Print the first 7 rows of the dataframe.\n",
    "3. Print the last 3 values of the 'Embarked' column.\n",
    "4. Create the dataframe 'df_southampton' that captures all passengers who embarked in Southampton.\n",
    "5. Add a column 'upper_class' that takes the value 1 if a passenger travelled 1st class and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "7. Add a colum 'family_size' that captures the number of parents/children/siblings/spouses that a passenger had onboard.\n",
    "7. Consider the relationship between 'upper_class' and 'Survived'. Why may the two be related? Compare survival chances among those who booked upper class and those who booked lower class.\n",
    "8. How many passengers who carried the name 'Charles' were on the Titanic? What was their average age? How many of them survived? You will need to google a bit to answer this question."
